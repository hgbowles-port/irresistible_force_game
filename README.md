# irresistible_force_game
I had an idea based on a random thing I said once:

# "Either become the Irresistible Force, or surrender to the Immovable Object"

I'm not sure what, but something about it resonated with me, and I decided to run with it.

The concept is a Roguelike game, where the player scales their own character to surpass increasingly difficult thresholds (immovable walls). I'm not sure if there will be an end point, or if this will scale infinitely. Perhaps I'll add modes for both?
